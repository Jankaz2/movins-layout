## General info

The aim of this application is to help the user find his favourite cinema 
(if it exists in our database), check what seances this cinema currently shows and book 
the ticket. All of these steps are really easy and fast to do with `Movins` web.
If you are `admin` you are able to manage all of the `cinemas`, `users`, and `seances`. You can create, delete or update new cinemas, add movies etc.

I decided to create this application to better understand the concept of commercial 
programs and get better at `React` library. I also mastered `SASS` and `HTML`
